invoices

In Settings -> Configuration -> Accounting you will find 2 new types of
rounding

- `Swedish Round globally`

  To round your invoice total amount, this option will do the adjustment in
  the most important tax line of your invoice.

- `Swedish Round by adding an invoice line`

  To round your invoice total amount, this option create a invoice line without
  taxes on it. This invoice line is tagged as `is_rounding`

You can choose the account on which the invoice line will be written
